            <h5>Summary and Takeaways:</h5>

            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">This map provides a clear and efficient visual representation of the varying levels of obesity across New York City's boroughs. By using a color-coded scale, it allows viewers to easily discern which areas have higher obesity rates without the need to interpret numerical data. While this map offers a general overview of obesity distribution in NYC, it does not define obesity or explain its health implications. The audience should understand why obesity is a concern and its associated risks.</p>

            <h5>Feedback:</h5>


            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">I inserted a medical definition for obesity and explained why being obese is dangerous. I also inclded why spreading awareness about populations that are obese is important. Lastly, I removed the data table as it just reiterated what is shown in the graph.</p>

            <h2>Individual NYC Borough Page Prototype</h2>
            <img src="/static/micro.jpg" alt="Micro Analysis" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 500px;">

            <h5>Summary and Takeaways:</h5>

            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">The graph allows the reader to see the trend of obesity in each specific borough over the past 18 years. It is very clear as it uses colors to make it so that the borough the page is about contrasts against the rest of the boroughs' trends, allowing the reader to understand not only the increase of obesity in that borough but also within the context of all the other boroughs.</p>

            <h5>Feedback:</h5>


            <p class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">The color emphasis on the line being discussed is effective, as it clearly distinguishes changes within a borough compared to others. This approach enhances the clarity of the title. Do not make the other boroughs' lines just gray, as this appears vague and unclear.</p>

                <dt>Obesity:</dt>
                <dd>This is a medical condition which is defined as excessive body fat accumulation that poses health risks, characterized by a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher. It increases the risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other diseases.</dd>

            <ul class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                <li>I included why it was important to increase awareness of obesity.</li>
                <li>I took away the table that I first included in my prototype on my broad NYC page as it was just redundant information.</li>
                <li>In my Individual Borough pages, I further specified the other borough lines by labeling them, making them seem more than just “gray lines”.</li>

            <h3>Pipeline for Creating My JSON Dictionary from CSV Data</h3>
            <ol class="mx-auto" style="max-width: 1000px;">
                    <li>The csv and json modules were imported to read CSV files (NYC.csv and Borough.csv) and to write JSON files.</li>
                    <li>Then the file paths were defined for the input CSV file (csv_file_path) and the output JSON file (json_file_path).</li>
                    <li>I initialized an empty dictionary named data_dict to hold the data from the CSV file.</li>
                    <li>I then opened the CSV file in read mode.</li>
                    <li>The CSV file is read using the readlines() function to read all lines of the CSV file into a list.</li>
                    <li>I processed each line in the CSV file, except the header line, and each line is placed in a loop. Each line is stripped of leading or trailing whitespace and split into geography and percent_obese for NYC.py, or year, geography, and percent_obese for Borough.py.</li>
                    <li>Only for Borough.py, I kept the geography names by using the replace() function to replace spaces in the geography names, which include “Manhattan”, “Bronx”, “Queens”, “Brooklyn”, “Staten Island.”</li>
                    <li>I then converted the obesity percentages to float. The float() function is used to convert the obesity percentage from a string to a float to ensure the numbers are in correct numerical format with just the number.</li>
                    <li>For NYC.py, I added all the data to the dictionary, data_dict.</li>
                    <li>For Borough.py, I structured the data based on the location and year. I first checked if the location “geography” already existed in the data storage (data_dict). If it doesn't exist, I create a new section for it. Then, I stored the obesity percentage for that location under the corresponding year.</li>
                    <li>I then wrote the dictionary to a JSON file using the json.dump() function to create my <a href="data/Borough.py">Borough.py</a> and <a href="">NYC.py</a>.</li>
